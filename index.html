            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">New York City has one of the most segregated public school systems in the country. The reasons for this are complex, but many of them relate to the interplay of housing segregation and how education policy sorts families into schools. This GIS spatial analysis uses DOE demographic data for elementary schools in New York City to identify neighborhoods that contain schools that are both significantly above and significantly below their borough’s average for students in poverty, identifying areas of the city that have the most potential to create more school integration. The project identifies which of these neighborhoods cross multiple school districts, suggesting a policy intervention in which several contiguous school districts could work together to create greater impact on integrating New York City’s schools.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Transit and transportation infrastructure are main priorities that local governments face when seeking to improve people’s quality of living and making cities more productive. Re-ordering traffic and decreasing commuting time, as well as increasing access to transportation facilities are the main aspects that governments focus on. Providing these services has an impact on the value of urban land and properties. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, since 2011 the local government has invested in the construction of the Metrobus, a local adaptation of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. This spatial study shows that, in the case of the Metrobus Norte, the construction of the network is spatially correlated with increased land values dating 2013 - 2018.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This GIS project thematically maps three main components of the NYC environment: impervious surfaces, flood potential areas and green space - all urban ecological indicators to take into account as the city decides and plans more resilient infrastructure systems. Sub-watersheds, a natural area feature as defined by the USGS, are utilized as the unit of analysis to summarize and present the analysis of these three indicators. The larger objective of this analysis is to provide a metric by which NYC can develop a resiliency design plan, as well as to strategize mitigation and adaptation to the pressures of climate change. By mapping the extent to which each sub-watershed contains the three indicators, priority can be determined as to what areas might benefit most from such resiliency tools as green infrastructure.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The fundamental question this project asks of GIS mapping techniques and software is “How can GIS methods and urban design thinking be used to increase engagement between the Industrial Port District of Newark and community members in the Ironbound neighborhood?” As the ironbound neighborhood stands permanently altered by the industrial development of the Port District and its subsequent industrial pollution over time, the ICC is working to develop new solutions for the development of The Industrial Port District, in an effort to ultimately propose new community based urban programming should the city reconsider the re-zoning of the Port – work that this project seeks to advance through the interpretation and visualization of geospatial data.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In this analysis, social and physical impacts are determined by looking at the populations and assets that are vulnerable to inundation to sea level rise and coastal flooding. The 1-in-100 year storm for the years 2015 and 2100. The GIS analysis was conducted following the static method first used in Nicholls et. al. in Ranking port cities with high exposure and vulnerability to climate extremes—exposure estimates (Nicholls et al., 2008). This method is widely accepted for global studies on vulnerability to sea level rise. Datasets that provide information on population, elevation, administrative boundaries, and physical assets (roads, buildings) were used to determine a quantitative vulnerability to sea-level rise. The findings that are associated with this study allow for a city-to-city comparison of risk, emphasizing the urgency to act now to address climate issues. Further, reducing impacts associated with greater temperature increases and prompting city planners to address vulnerability and prioritize adaption strategies are larger research goals associated with this GIS analysis.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">New York City’s affordable housing stock is vulnerable to coastal flooding under current and projected climate scenarios. Using GIS software and publicly available data from NYC Open Data with NYC MapPLUTO parcel base as the unit of analysis, large scale mapping was conducted to assess the exposure of coastal flooding at 101 properties managed by Hope and Ascendant community-development corporations (CDC). Results show that properties are at risk under both current and future floodplain projections. This result is important considering that New York City’s stock of affordable housing hosts some of the most vulnerable populations in the city, with less ability to move elsewhere before or after a flooding event.</p>
